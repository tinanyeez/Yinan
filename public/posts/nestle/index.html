<meta name="description" content="Nestle, the world&rsquo;s leading food and beverage company, has a wide range of product lines, from coffee to pet food. However, consumers have a limited understanding of Nestle&rsquo;s entire product line, especially focusing on a few products such as coffee. This project aims to enhance consumers&rsquo; awareness of Nestle products in various categories through virtual reality technology, as well as increase their interest and activity in purchasing across categories.
We will launch a virtual reality experience called &lsquo;Nestle World&rsquo;. In the early stage of the project, we will let consumers experience in the form of pop-up stores. Within the virtual space, consumers will gain a deeper understanding of Nestle&rsquo;s diverse products through an immersive and interactive experience. The experience will revolve around different virtual environments, such as a virtual kitchen, a virtual cafe and a virtual petting park, each of which will naturally fit into Nestle&rsquo;s different product categories.">
