Nestle, the world's leading food and beverage company, has a wide range of product lines, from coffee to pet food. However, consumers have a limited understanding of Nestle's entire product line, especially focusing on a few products such as coffee. This project aims to enhance consumers' awareness of Nestle products in various categories through virtual reality technology, as well as increase their interest and activity in purchasing across categories.

We will launch a virtual reality experience called 'Nestle World'. In the early stage of the project, we will let consumers experience in the form of pop-up stores. Within the virtual space, consumers will gain a deeper understanding of Nestle's diverse products through an immersive and interactive experience. The experience will revolve around different virtual environments, such as a virtual kitchen, a virtual cafe and a virtual petting park, each of which will naturally fit into Nestle's different product categories.

In order to increase interactivity and engagement, we will add fun elements to the virtual environment, such as completing specific tasks, challenges, and earning rewards. After accumulating points in the game, consumers can redeem physical Nestle products directly at the pop-up store, or purchase products used during the experience themselves. If the pop-up store market works well, we will further promote Nestle's cooperation with well-known games, implant Nestle products in them, and plan to open long-term offline experience stores.
