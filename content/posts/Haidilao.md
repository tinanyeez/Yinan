This is a project that uses simulation to digitize real-world problems and provide solutions or improvements. We collect real-world data and use AnyLogic for system simulation.

Specifically, we use the queuing number collection online system of the Haidilao to collect number collection and number calling data for three consecutive days for subsequent arrival rate and service rate. We also went to a Haidilao to ask the staff about the store, including the floor area, the number of different table types and other information.

In AnyLogic, we use the known information to design the system, use different sources to represent the arrival of different table types and different dates, use schedule to store the arrival information of different dates, build the income function, run the simulation, calculate the income distribution and confidence interval of different table types according to the table turnover rate, and realize the profit maximization.

Finally, we collate the system information, provide suggestions for optimal table distribution, and summarize the limitations of this simulation project.
